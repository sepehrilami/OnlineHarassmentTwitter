And I'm guessing he didn't apologize directly to all the women he has harassed and whose careers he stunted/destroyed. https://t.co/yJAeKso8bj

1. Start with an apology. 
2. Make it real. Don’t apologize to women who “felt” they were treated “inappropriately.” That’s basically saying “I’m sorry you feel like you were harassed.” 
3. Take ownership — it was your campaign, no matter the number of staffers. https://t.co/QrC96cUgS0"
